	<label>Sample Master</label> <!-- If auto-generating the master page thumbnail, LiveBall will use the value of the label here on top of a screenshot of the master page layout. -->
	<description>Sample master description</description>
	<category>Sample master category</category> <!-- The category is optional, include if you would like to categorize your master page layouts into specific categories. For instance, you could place all of your masters with forms in to a category called "Form Pages". This will allow the end user to pick the type of layout desired based on category. Great tool for frameworks with a lot of master page layouts. If you choose not to use this feature, remove the entire "category" tag here.-->
