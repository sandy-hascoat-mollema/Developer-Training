# Developer Training

Created and managed ion's developer training guide. The guide includes documentation (originally written by the CTO, then heavly updated/changed by me when as ion platform evolved) with references to sample code files. Videos are also available to view on the support site.

NOTE: This guide is no longer in use (hence the 2013 last updated date). The ion platform no longer uses master page templates for page creation.
