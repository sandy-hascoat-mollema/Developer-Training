# Developer Training

Created and managed ion's developer training guide. The guide includes documentation (originally written by the CTO, then heavily updated/changed by me as the ion platform evolved) with references to sample code files that I put together from scratch. 

I also conducted customer training sessions via GoToMeeting for those needing extra help. As we started getting a lot of training requests, I created tutorial videos that can be seen on the ion support site here:

NOTE: This guide is no longer in use (hence the 2013 last updated date). The ion platform no longer uses master page templates for page creation.
